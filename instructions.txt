Install Docker on your system:
    $ sudo apt install docker docker.io

Create a file called Dockerfile which contains the specs of the docker image that you want to create. If you want to create a new docker image, its Dockerfile must be kept in a different directory.

For MM, the Dockerfile is inside ~/Desktop/MM. To build the Dockerfile,
    $ cd ~/Desktop/MM && sudo docker build -t fetch_sim .
        here, we declare the name of the image to be fetch_sim 
    $ sudo docker image list
        check if image got built

For convenience, define a bunch of shell scripts for operating docker:
1. Create a directory for storing the shell scripts:
    $ cd && mkdir Docker
2. Create docker_exec.sh, docker_kill.sh, docker_run.sh
3.
